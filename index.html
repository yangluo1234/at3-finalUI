        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Sound Constellation is an interactive audio UI where users connect
          stars to build a melody and then replay the path as a constellation
          line. The concept blends a night sky metaphor with a playable
          synthesiser. The project responds to the “No text characters” creative
          response, and the UI is built on the provided Tone.js audio system.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="card">
        <h2>Guiding Values and How They Shaped The UI</h2>
        <p>
          Clarity means the interface communicates through shape and motion
          instead of text. The stars act as the only main controls. The play and
          clear buttons sit below the field and are easy to find.
        </p>
        <p>
          Playfulness comes from the scattered layout and the glowing look.
          Users can click any star, hear a tone, and draw a line that forms a
          small melody.
        </p>
        <p>
          Immersion is created by sound and light working together. Each star
          gives a short pulse, and the notes have small natural variations. This
          makes the night sky feel alive.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Feedback, Information Design, Mapping, And Learnability</h2>
        <p>
          The UI gives immediate feedback. Each click plays a note at once, and
          the star flashes brighter with a short scale pop, while the canvas
          draws a line from the last star to the new one. The background hue
          shifts slightly when Play runs, and small timing and velocity
          randomness make repeats feel alive. The reverb icon grows and changes
          colour as the slider moves, so the effect feels visible as well as
          audible. The twinkling animation signal interactivity without text,
          which fits the no-text characters prompt. The Clear button wipes lines
          and memory, giving a clean reset when users want to start a new
          constellation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The information design follows a clear hierarchy. The sky is the main
          stage in the centre. The controls sit below and, the footer stays at
          the bottom. Stars and lines live in the sky layer, while play, reset,
          and reverb stay in the controls layer to keep things tidy. High
          contrast guides focus, with bright stars on a dark background and
          yellow accents on buttons. Because I follow the no-text characters
          prompt, meaning is carried by icons, motion, and sound
        </p>
        <p>
          The mapping uses a scattered night-sky layout rather than a grid. Each
          star is a direct control, and users can click in any order. The system
          draws a line after each click, so the visual path mirrors the musical
          sequence. This freedom mapping feels like sketching a constellation
          and encourages open exploration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learnability relies on familiar iconography and immediate feedback.
          The play triangle, reset arrows, and water-drop reverb icon act as
          quite signposts, so most users already know what they do. After one
          click, the system confirms the choice with sound, a brief star flash,
          and a line drawing, which teaches the interaction without
          instructions. Because controls are few and consistent, most users
          succeed on first use and build confidence quickly.
        </p>

        <h2>Significant Change From Prototype To Final UI</h2>
        <p>
          First, I replaced the 4*4 grid with a scattered night sky layout
          because the grid looked like a tool, not a constellation. The free
          positions let users draw any path, and the screen reads more like a
          sky. This change also aligns better with the no text characters prompt
          because the idea is carried by spatial composition rather than labels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, I added a twinkle animation to each star, so the page feels
          alive before the first click. The motion is slow and small to avoid
          distraction. In quick tests with classmates, most people noticed the
          stars and understood they were interactive without me telling them. A
          few people said the twinkle could be slightly stronger on small
          screens, so I increased the mid keyframe scale and opacity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third,I increased contrast in the controls by moving to yellow accents
          on a deep blue black background. The goal was to improve legibility
          and make the play and reset icons readable at a glance. I checked
          contrast with simple eyedrop tests, and the buttons now stand out
          while still feeling part of the night theme.
        </p>
        <p>
          These changes improved immersion and clarity, but they also introduced
          trade-offs. The scattered layout is less regular, so I had to
          pre-place the stars with percentages to keep balance across screens.
          If I had more time, I would add a small onboarding hint that fades
          after the first tap, and a toggle to adjust twinkle strength on very
          bright displays.

        <h2>Production Timeline In 9 Weeks</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>Week 1</h3>
          <p>
            I set an early goal to fix the concept and build a small test. I
            first tried a no text idea with geometric shapes. It worked but felt
            flat. User actions did not feel meaningful. This helped me realise
            that the metaphor matters as much as the sound.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Week2 - Week 3</h3>
          <p>
            After research, I shifted to a constellation idea. The star metaphor
            made immediate sense. It supported free drawing and listening. I
            kept the scope small so I could deliver a working path from click to
            sound.
          </p>
          <p>
            I built the prototype with a 4*4 grid. My goal was clarity. The grid
            looked like a canvas so users could understand clicking and
            connecting quickly. It worked, but the mood felt too mechanical and
            less like a night sky. This tension between clarity and character
            became my main design question.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Week 4 - Week 6</h3>
          <p>
            I rebuilt the interaction around scattered stars. Each click plays a
            note and adds a point to a path so drawing and sound match. I kept
            the logic simple and stable. I also reworked the visual hierarchy.
            Stars and lines stay in the sky layer while the play, reset and
            reverb controls sit below. I began increasing contrast so controls
            read better on a dark background.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Week 7 - Week 8</h3>
          <p>
            I focused on polish and feedback. I added a gentile twinkle using
            CSS animation and a short flash on click. These cues make the stars
            feel alive without adding text. I also changed button styling to a
            darker base with yellow accents to improve contrast and keep the
            theme of night and starlight. Much of this time was research and
            small trials, since several techniques were outside class material.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Final week</h3>
          <p>
            I tested my project again and again, cleaned up small
            inconsistencies and added code comments so the mapping and drawing
            logic are clear.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking back, most time went to concept and interaction decisions
            rather than pure coding. The grid prototype taught me that clarity
            can reduce character. The final scattered sky keeps learnability but
            adds atmosphere and freedom. I learned to fix one core flow early,
            ship it, then improve it with focused changes based on feedback and
            testing.

        <h2>The Aspect I’m Most Proud Of</h2>
        <p>
          I am most proud of the idea and how it is presented in the final UI.
          At the start, I only had a simple plan to use different shapes to
          trigger different sounds. It was very basic and did not feel
          meaningful. Through research and brainstorming, I found a clearer
          concept. Turning the interface into a night sky where users draw their
          own constellation made the interaction feel open and poetic, not just
          functional.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also proud that I could realise this idea with self learning. I
          taught myself the parts I was missing, like using CSS animation for a
          gentle twinkle and a short flash on press, and mapping user taps to
          lines so the drawn path matches the melody. I learned to keep the
          interface mostly text-free and rely on icons, motion and sound to
          guide the user. This balance of concept and implementation shows
          growth in both design thinking and technical skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, I value how the UI feels when you use it. The scattered stars
          invite exploration, the audio has small randomness for a natural
          touch, and the controls are clear at a glance. This combination came
          from feedback, testing and iteration, and it reflects the kind of work
          I want to keep doing.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="card">
        <h2>The Aspect I'm Most Challenging</h2>
        <p>
          The most challenging part was the audio side. I started with almost no
          music theory and I did not know what delay, filter, reverb or even
          notes really meant. Even reading explanations in my first language
          felt confusing because these terms were new to me and I was not very
          interested in music before. For this project I had to push myself to
          learn the basics. I studied simple scales and note names, and I read
          how common effects shape the sound.
        </p>
        <p>
          This learning changed how I designed the UI. I kept the controls small
          in number so users do not face the same confusion I had. I chose one
          clear slider for reverb because it gives an immediate sense of space,
          and I left delay and filter as internal settings rather than complex
          panels. I also added tiny randomness to note timing and velocity to
          make the sequence feel more natural. I tested by ear, compared
          outcomes, and adjusted until the feedback sounded right.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, I learned the fundamentals that I actually needed. I can
          now describe what reverb does, how a filter changes brightness, and
          how note choice affects mood. This was harder for me than coding or
          CSS, but it made the final interface more thoughtful and easier to
          use.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="card">
        <h2>Next steps</h2>
        <p>
          My next step is to make the constellation feel richer without adding
          heavy UI. I plan to offer two or three preset skies that load
          different note sets so people can explore different moods. I also want
          to add a save and share option so a user can copy a link and replay
          their drawing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will continue to improve feedback. The twinkle will have small
          variation in speed and brightness, so the sky feels more alive. The
          play path will glow while it is read so timing is easy to follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the technical side I will refine performance on mobile. I may also
          run a short user test with my friends to measure learnability. I will
          ask them to draw a shape, play it, clear it, and explain what they
          think the slider does. Their feedback will guide the next round of
          polish.
